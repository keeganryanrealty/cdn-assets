      <h2>About</h2>
      <p class="body-font">My name is Keegan Ryan, and I’m passionate about helping people move forward with clarity and confidence.</p>
      <p class="body-font">I live in the south metro with my wife, Ella, and our German Shepherd, Nova. Outside of work, I enjoy trying new coffee shops and restaurants, playing music, and volunteering in the community. I’m also involved at River Valley Church, where I serve in worship ministry, and I hold a degree in Ministry from Southeastern University.</p>
      <p class="body-font">I’ve been mentored by top-performing agents—both locally through Keller Williams, eXp, and nationally through coaching with Aaron Yoon’s team. Their guidance has shaped the way I approach negotiation, client relationships, and decision-making—with clarity, strategy, and care at the center of it all.</p>
      <p class="body-font">I believe buying or selling a home shouldn’t feel overwhelming. It should feel personal, purposeful, and built on trust. My job is to help you move forward with confidence—not just into your next chapter, but toward the best future you can imagine.</p>
