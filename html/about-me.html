      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m a Minnesota-based realtor who helps families upsize confidently and move with peace of mind. My wife, our dog, and I love exploring the area, spending time with family, and helping others find the space that fits their life best.</p>
      <p>Whether you’re looking for a little more room to grow or want to finally move into your dream home, I’d be honored to help.</p>
